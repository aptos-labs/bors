# A merge bot for GitHub pull requests

Bors is a Github App used to manage merging of PRs in order to ensure that CI is always green.
It does so by maintaining a Merge Queue.
Once a PR reaches the head of the Merge Queue it is rebased on top of the latest version of the PR's base-branch (generally master) and then triggers CI.
If CI comes back green the PR is then merged into the base-branch.
Regardless of the outcome, the next PR is the queue is then processed.

### Setup + Configuration
